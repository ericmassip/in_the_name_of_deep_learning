# In The Name Of Deep Learning

In this project, we analyze the value of Convolutional Neural Networks for two topics in image processing: feature extraction and image segmentation. The data used in this project is a subset of a well-known dataset, PASCAL VOC-20091, which has been used to train different architectures of neural networks as a benchmarking dataset. 

In the feature extraction section, we have tested different autoencoder settings with several codification factors such as 6, 12 and 24 achieving a Mean Squared Error of 0.01.

In image classification, we could demonstrate that the Deep CNN performs widely better than a feature extraction architecture with a fully connected layer. 

In the segmentation section, we obtained a promising pixel-wise classifier with a Dice coefficient value of 0.68.
